console.log(strWithAsteric);
```

## Write a program to check whether a String is empty

```js
let str = "ddgaadsd afsd";
let emptyStr = "";

console.log((str.length === 0 ) ? "Empty" : `Not empty and str = "${str}"`);
// Not empty and str = "ddgaadsd afsd"

console.log((emptyStr.length === 0 ) ? "Empty" : "Not empty");
// Empty

```

## Write a program to find the length of String

```js
let str = "sgdfg drghdf asg"

console.log(`lenght of ${str} = ${str.length}`);
// lenght of sgdfg drghdf asg = 16
```

## Write a program to check the index of g in String "Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn"

```js
let str = "Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn"

console.log(`Index of 'g' in ${str} = ${str.indexOf("g")}`);
// Index of 'g' in Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn = 13
```

## Write a program to check the last index of y in String "Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn"

```js
let str = "Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn"
let reverseStr = [...str ].reverse().join("");

let ind = reverseStr.indexOf("y");
console.log(ind !== -1 ? `Last Index of 'y' in ${str} = ${ind}` : "'y' is not present in string");
// Last Index of 'y' in Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn = 44

let ind = str.lastIndexOf("y");
console.log(ind !== -1 ? `Last Index of 'y' in ${str} = ${ind}` : "'y' is not present in string");
// Last Index of 'y' in Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn = 44
```

## Write a program to check the index of "programming” in String "Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn"

```js
let str = "Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn"
let ind = str.indexOf("programming");

console.log(ind!==-1 ? `Index of "programming" in ${str} is ${ind}` : "Not present");
// Index of "programming" in Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn is 10
```

## Write a program to check the last index of “easy” in String “Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn”

```js
let str = "Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn"
let LastInd = str.indexOf("programming");

console.log(LastInd !== -1 ? `Last Index of "easy" in ${str} is ${LastInd}` : "Not present");
// Last Index of "easy" in Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn is 10
```

## Write a program to remove all “i” from String “Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn”

```js
let str = "Java is a programming language and it is easy to learn";

```

## Write a program to replace all lower case with upper case in String "Java is a Programming Language and it is Easy to Learn"

```js
let str = "Java is a Programming Language and it is Easy to Learn";
let newStr = str.toUpperCase();

console.log(newStr);
// JAVA IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND IT IS EASY TO LEARN
```

## Write a program to remove starting spaces from String “            Java is a Programming Language and it is Easy to Learn”

```js
let str = "            Java is a Programming Language and it is Easy to Learn";

let newStr = str.trim();

console.log(newStr);

function palindromeCheck(str) {
    str = str.toLowerCase();
    let reversedStr = str.split("").reverse().join("");
    return str === reversedStr;
}
let str = "anything goes here";
let pStr = "level";

console.log(palindromeCheck(str) ? "It is Palindrome" : "It is not a palindrome");
